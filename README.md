<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Photografh is a niche one-stop web application that will increase photographer’s visibility and increase customer satisfaction in choosing the best photography and videography services.

Clients can browse different styles of photos or photographers based on their requirements. With a standardised search and filter (Ratings, Reviews, Categories, Location, Budget) in place, comparing services would be fast and efficient.

Photographers can apply on our platform by providing their general location, background information, prices and will undergo an approval process. Upon approval, the photographer’s profile will be public and be available for booking. Photographers can customise their packages and using a standardised pricing model, they can enable/disable charges (for e.g. weekend charge, $X f or Y edits)

After the client has browsed and chosen their style and package, clients can book a timeslot on the photographer’s profile page which has to be accepted by the photographer within 24 hours. Photografh shall hold all payments until the service has been completed.
